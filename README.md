JiveJS - Web UI Made Simple
===

Use standard HTML and CSS practices to create rich UI components without 
writing a single line of Javascript. Dig deeper and find a rock solid, object oriented UI 
interface with all the tools you need.
							
## Mean, Lean UI Machine

Weighing in at a mere 19kb, Jive will be one of the smallest dependencies on your page. It is built ontop of the 
popular JS framework, jQuery.
	
## White Label UI
				
Unlike other UI libraries like Bootstrap, Jive is a white label UI framework meaning that it has no aesthetic styling. 
Buttons, menus, and other UI components only have the barebones stylings. The rest of it is up to you. If there's one 
thing we've learned: designers are pretty picky people so we give them complete creative freedom by having no hand
in design choices.
	
## JiveJS was built to make things easy
				
Developers always need common UI components such tabbed interfaces, overlays, and slideshows. There have been 
alot of attempts to solve this problem. Everytime we went with one toolkit over another, 
we always had to hack it to pieces to work <i>within the scope of design</i> or write a lot of javscript hooks to make function.
We were sick of it and said: damnit, can't we just write HTML and let JS do the rest? </p>
					
## The Goal: simple to learn but powerful under the hood
				
Since Jive is essentially a "HTML markup framework for UI component delegation" (oh god), it means that anyone who knows a little
HTML can get busy, quick. Dig deeper and you will find a highly organized, object oriented approach to Javascript that makes
jQuery plugins look like old punch-card code. While thing is library is built ontop of jQuery, we've taken a different approach
towards UI component development.

Seriously, if you are still here go build something ya dummy!
